toric-geometry
==============

This is a module to compute project embeddings coming from rational convex
polytopes within the context of toric geometry. It is meant to be run as a
module from within the python interpreter.

Note that at this point, the relations produced are not minimal. Making them
minimal will require a little more work, though it is in principal farely
straight-forward...hopefully I'll do that soon.
